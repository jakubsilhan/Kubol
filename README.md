# Kubol
Kubol is a custom language based on a combination of languages. The project focuses on creating the frontend of language compilation.

## How to run
First you need to obtain a correct jar file. Either through compilation using command line or an IDE.

Afterwards you just need to write your code into a text file and give that text file to the used jar. This can be accomplished by this command:  
`java -jar .\Language_Kubol.jar .\input.kb .\output.txt`

The output file contains all imagined(printed) data and errors.
