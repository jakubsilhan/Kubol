# Kubol
Kubol is a custom language based on a combination of languages. The project focuses on creating the frontend of language compilation.

## How to run
First you need to obtain a correct jar file. Either through compilation using command line or an IDE.  
The jar is also available in this directory for immediate use.

Afterwards you just need to write your code into a `.kb` file and give that `.kb` file to the used jar. This can be accomplished by this command:  
`java -jar ./Language_Kubol.jar ./input.kb ./output.txt`

The output file contains all imagined(printed) data and errors.
